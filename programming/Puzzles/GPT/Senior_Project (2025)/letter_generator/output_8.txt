Your guidance and support have provided them with valuable real-world learning opportunities that have enriched their academic experiences.

As we look forward to the upcoming 2025/2026 school year, I would like to extend an invitation for you to once again participate as a community sponsor in our senior project program. Your knowledge and experience make you an invaluable mentor for our students, and we believe that your continued involvement will greatly benefit them as they explore career opportunities in engineering and manufacturing.

We are appreciative of the time and effort you have dedicated to our students in the past, and we would be honored to have you back as part of our program. Your commitment to their growth and development is commendable, and we are grateful for the positive impact you have had on their educational experiences.

If you are able to join us again this year, please let me know at your earliest convenience. Your dedication to providing enriching learning experiences for our students is highly valued, and we would be delighted to have you guide our seniors once more.

Thank you, Mr. Robinson, for your past support and for considering this invitation. Your involvement in our program has been truly valuable, and we look forward to the opportunity to collaborate with you again to provide meaningful experiences for our students.

Warm regards,

Mrs. Joanna McNally
Founder of Career Compass
