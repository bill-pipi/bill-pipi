SENIOR PROJECT PROPOSAL DEFENSE 
	REQUIREMENT 1: 
Project must be in an APPROVED CATEGORY.  
	Explanation of Requirement:
	Explanation of how your Project meets this requirement.  
	Requirement 1: Project must be in an APPROVED CATEGORY.  

Begin with an overview of what you will be doing for your Project. 
 
Then explain how your project fits into one or more of the four categories below. 
 1)Education Pursuit        
 2) Career Exploration      
 3) Creative Endeavor     
 4) Community Service
	Community Service
I will streamline the data from the past 7 years of senior project into a single database to create a shadow/mentor spreadsheet for use by the OHS Gifted & Talented Program overseen by Mrs. Frazier and Mrs. McNally. I will also organize each community sponsor by their profession in order to help future students better connect to opportunities. I will also create a framework that would allow new entries to be organized in this manner.. This database can also apply not only to senior project students, but also students independently looking for career opportunities in general.. This would fit the project into the category of education pursuit as it helps other students pursue opportunities of interest, and also explore future careers. This is also a community service project as it helps the student community at Orange High School.


	REQUIREMENT 2: 
Student must have a VALID COMMUNITY SPONSOR.  
	Explanation of Requirement:
	Explanation of how your Project meets this requirement.  
	Requirement 2: Student must have a VALID COMMUNITY SPONSOR.  

Explain who will be serving as your Community Sponsor and how you came to know this person. 

Explain the Sponsor’s qualifications and articulate what makes the Sponsor an expert in the field you wish to explore.
	Mrs. McNally will be my community sponsor; known through independent study  research at Orange High School from year 11 and  12. 




Mrs. McNally has invaluable experience in diverse student opportunities, programs, and organizations being the head of the gifted department, as well as having extensive knowledge of past community sponsors/mentors and student interests for the future. 
	REQUIREMENT 3: 
Project must enhance COMMUNICATION SKILLS. 
	Explanation of Requirement:
	Explanation of how your Project meets this requirement.  
	Explanation of what evidence you will provide at the Senior Fair  to show you have met this requirement.  
	Requirement 3: Project must enhance COMMUNICATION SKILLS. 


Explain how your project will enhance your communication skills.  
	

This project will enhance my communication skills because I will be working with both Mrs. McNally, Mrs. Frazier, and connecting with past and potential community sponsors and mentors. I will also need to reach out and communicate extensively to a diverse array of potential community sponsors that all come from unique fields in order to connect them to this program.

	REQUIREMENT 4: 
Project must enhance CRITICAL THINKING or PROBLEM SOLVING SKILLS
	Explanation of Requirement:
	Explanation of how your Project meets this requirement.

	Requirement 4: Project must enhance CRITICAL THINKING or PROBLEM SOLVING SKILLS


Explain how your project will challenge you to learn and grow in the area of critical thinking or problem solving.  
	I will need to use critical thinking in order to help create a software program that would be able to streamline all the data into a single efficient framework that can be easily referenced by future students and teachers to find potential mentors. I will also need to use problem-solving skills in order to reach out to community mentors and sponsors if they are not on the list. In general, I will have to use my computer programming skills and prior experience in order to implement this project. I also hope to create a career day for freshmans and sophomores.

Research is an important skill that is utilized in all careers and aspects of life.  Explain how  you plan to learn about the research processes used by your Community Sponsor and/or how you will use your research skills during your project? 
	I will need to research diverse career fields in order to create a database of community sponsors and mentors that could fit all student interests. This would require finding potential sponsors/mentors emails and contracts, finding fields that are most of interest to the Orange student community, and determining how to better prepare students for future career opportunities.
	Evidence can be shown through a daily log, the spreadsheet of mentors/sponsors and their contacts, google form, etc.

	EVIDENCE FOR GOAL 1: 


The program and the finished database as well as the google form for sponsors/mentors.
	ACTIVITIES FOR GOAL 1: 


I will create a software program that will sort all the past entries into the single database, and also find a method to group them into separate categories. I will also find a way to make this automatic, and create a google form for potential community  mentors/sponsors to fill out in order to be entered into the database. Last of all, I will design the database in a way that it will be easy to reference and use for students and teachers to connect to opportunities.

	WEEK 1 REFLECTIVE JOURNAL 
	Write your journal here:  (This sample journal is 344 words)
        I was amazed at all the learning that seemed to be going on in Mrs. Brown’s class, and I feel that I have a lot to learn.  So many different activities were going on at all times that it seemed like a three-ring circus.  I don’t remember all that activity when I was in second grade.  As Mrs. Brown showed me all the planning that goes into just one day of the week, I realized the tremendous effort she puts into her teaching.  She has so much patience with them, especially with the two little boys who got into a fight and started calling each other bad names.  She didn’t get angry at all, and she helped them to apologize to each other and to her.  When she introduced me to the class, she introduced me as Miss Brewer.  I’m not sure I liked that, but I guess if I’m going to be working with small children, they have to learn that I am not one of them.  This way, maybe they will respect me more.  By the end of the week, I managed to learn all of the children’s names.  It’s the end of the first week and am I tired!  One little girl who seemed very shy and withdrawn hung onto my arm all during the time that I had playground duty.  Although I rather enjoyed that, I am still wondering what makes her so shy and whether this is her way of showing her insecurity.  I think I’ll ask Mrs. Brown if I can work with Jill and help her to be more outgoing.  Next week I’m also supposed to help two or three of the weaker students drill this week’s vocabulary words.  I hope I can really help improve their grades.  One realization I have already made is that I do enjoy working with children this age.  I love their spontaneity and honesty.  Their excitement over the assignments related to the park ranger’s visit was so refreshing.  It made me remember how  much fun learning about the world can be.

	WEEK 1 REFLECTIVE JOURNAL 
	Write your journal here (must be at least 250 words):


First, I received access to all past community sponsor databases. However, some of the entries were in an inconsistent format, so I first had to organize them in a way that the database would be processed effectively. Then, I copied all the entries into a single community sponsor database consisting of around 500 individual records. Afterwards, I removed duplicates by sorting the community sponsors by name, which removed approximately 80 entries. I then began to fill out the sponsor contact information. This was tedious, and required searching the sponsor’s name and their organization on the internet, and then trying to find references to their email. For the sponsors with no applicable email, I put “No applicable email” or just entered in their organization email. In searching for contact information, I also figured out whether community sponsors either moved to different organizations, or were no longer able to be be community sponsors. This removed another approximately 50 entries from the database. I also was able to enter phone contacts for sponsors with no available email. After the database was finalized, I created a separate category, which was what field of interest each community sponsor specialized in. This ranges from animal care to insurance, to government/law. A challenging part of this was determining how many categories were necessary, and whether categories should be differentiated or grouped together. I then organized each community sponsor into one of the categories. However, some of these were difficult to categorize because of their ambiguity, and also because of the shear size of the database.
